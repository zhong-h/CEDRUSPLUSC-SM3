/*
 * Generate the entire Merkle tree, computing the authentication path for leaf_idx,
 * and the resulting root node using Merkle's TreeHash algorithm.
 * Expects the layer and tree parts of the tree_addr to be set, as well as the
 * tree type (i.e. SPX_ADDR_TYPE_HASHTREE or SPX_ADDR_TYPE_FORSTREE)
 *
 * This expects tree_addr to be initialized to four parallel address structures
 * for the Merkle tree nodes.
 *
 * Applies the offset idx_offset to indices before building addresses, so that
 * it is possible to continue counting indices across trees.
 *
 * This works by using the standard Merkle tree building algorithm, except
 * that each logical stack entry tracks four consecutive nodes in the real tree.
 * When we combine two logical nodes ABCD and WXYZ, we perform the H
 * operation on adjacent real nodes, forming the parent logical node
 * (AB)(CD)(WX)(YZ)
 *
 * When we get to the top two levels of the real tree (where there is only
 * one logical node), we continue this operation two more times; the right
 * most real node will by the actual root (and the other 3 nodes will be
 * garbage).  The four real parent hashes are computed directly; after SM3
 * hashing was standardized to the scalar implementation, filling duplicate
 * lanes would only repeat work.
 *
 * This currently assumes tree_height >= 2; I suspect that doing an adjusting
 * idx, addr_idx on the gen_leaf call if tree_height < 2 would fix it; since
 * we don't actually use such short trees, I haven't bothered
