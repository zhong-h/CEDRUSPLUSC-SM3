 * Expects the layer and tree parts of the tree_addr to be set, as well as the
 * tree type (i.e. SPX_ADDR_TYPE_HASHTREE or SPX_ADDR_TYPE_FORSTREE).
 * Applies the offset idx_offset to indices before building addresses, so that
 * it is possible to continue counting indices across trees.
 *
 * This implementation uses AVX2 x8 hashing and keeps four adjacent Merkle
 * nodes in each logical stack entry.
